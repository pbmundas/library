Cloud API Calls with High Rate Limits | Cloud API calls exceeding rate limits, as in 2025 trends. | - Cloud Audit Logs (AWS IAM, Azure AD) | - **Splunk**: `index=cloud sourcetype=aws:iam OR sourcetype=azure:ad eventName IN ("APICall") \| timechart span=1m count by user \| where count > rate_limit_threshold`.<br>- **KQL**: `CloudAppEvents \| where ActionType in ("APICall") \| summarize MinuteCount=count() by bin(Timestamp, 1m), Account \| where MinuteCount > rateLimitThreshold`.<br>- **ELK**: `FROM logs-aws.iam-* OR logs-azure.ad-* \| WHERE event.action IN ['APICall'] \| STATS COUNT() BY date_histogram(@timestamp, '1m'), user.name \| WHERE COUNT() > rate_limit_threshold`. |
| 9. Cloud API Calls with Anomalous Patterns | Cloud API calls with repetitive or scripted patterns, as in Volt Typhoon. | - Cloud Audit Logs (AWS IAM, Azure AD) | - **Splunk**: `index=cloud sourcetype=aws:iam OR sourcetype=azure:ad eventName IN ("CreateInstance", "RunInstances", "CreateUser") \| timechart span=1s count by user \| where count > avg(count)*5`.<br>- **KQL**: `CloudAppEvents \| where ActionType in ("CreateInstance", "RunInstances", "CreateUser") \| summarize SecondCount=count() by bin(Timestamp, 1s), Account \| where SecondCount > avg(SecondCount) * 5`.<br>- **ELK**: `FROM logs-aws.iam-* OR logs-azure.ad-* \| WHERE event.action IN ['CreateInstance', 'RunInstances', 'CreateUser'] \| STATS COUNT() BY date_histogram(@timestamp, '1s'), user.name \| WHERE COUNT() > AVG(COUNT()) * 5`. |
| 10. Cloud API Calls via Known Vulnerable Services | Cloud API calls via vulnerable services, as in FIN7. | - Cloud Audit Logs (AWS IAM, Azure AD)<br>- Threat Intelligence | - **Splunk**: `index=cloud sourcetype=aws:iam OR sourcetype=azure:ad eventName IN ("CreateInstance", "RunInstances", "CreateUser") AND service IN (known_vuln_services) \| stats count by user, service, src_ip \| where count > 5`.<br>- **KQL**: `CloudAppEvents \| where ActionType in ("CreateInstance", "RunInstances", "CreateUser") and ServiceName in (knownVulnServices) \| summarize count() by Account, ServiceName, ClientIP \| where count_ > 5`.<br>- **ELK**: `FROM logs-aws.iam-* OR logs-azure.ad-* \| WHERE event.action IN ['CreateInstance', 'RunInstances', 'CreateUser'] AND event.service IN ['known_vuln_services'] \| STATS COUNT() BY user.name, event.service, source.ip HAVING COUNT() > 5`. |
