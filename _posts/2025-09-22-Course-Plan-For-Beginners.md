Below is a deep dive into the **Beginner Modules** from the provided threat hunting curriculum table, focusing on the five beginner-level modules (1–5). I’ve expanded each module with detailed content, maintaining the markdown format as requested, and merged related information into a maximum of four columns for clarity and page fit. The content is enriched with in-depth explanations of key topics, learning objectives, tools/techniques, and resources, while keeping the structure consistent with the original table.

| Level     | Module | Key Topics & Learning Objectives | Tools, Techniques & Resources |
|-----------|--------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Beginner | 1. Introduction to Cybersecurity Fundamentals | **Key Topics**: Core cybersecurity concepts (confidentiality, integrity, availability - CIA triad), threat landscape (cybercrime, nation-state actors, hacktivists), common attack vectors (phishing, malware, social engineering), risk management principles (identify, assess, mitigate), basic incident response (containment, eradication, recovery), introduction to threat hunting’s role in proactive defense.<br>**Learning Objectives**: Understand foundational cybersecurity principles; recognize common threats and their impact; differentiate reactive (incident response) vs. proactive (threat hunting) approaches; grasp how the CIA triad guides security strategies; begin formulating basic threat hypotheses. *Example*: Learn to identify phishing indicators in emails or suspicious processes in a system. | **Tools/Techniques**: Basic threat modeling (e.g., STRIDE model to categorize threats); vulnerability scanning to identify system weaknesses; hypothesis formulation (e.g., “What if an attacker used stolen credentials?”). **Tools**: Nmap for port scanning, Wireshark for basic packet sniffing, command-line tools (ping, traceroute). <br>**Resources**: *Books*: “Hacking: The Art of Exploitation” (Jon Erickson) for hands-on basics; *Online*: Cybrary’s free cybersecurity fundamentals, TryHackMe’s intro rooms (e.g., “Basic Pentesting”); *Courses*: Coursera’s “Cybersecurity for Everyone” (2025 update, ~10 hours), Codecademy’s “Threat Hunting” intro module. *Time*: 20–30 hours. |
| Beginner | 2. Networking and Operating Systems Basics | **Key Topics**: Networking fundamentals (TCP/IP stack, OSI model, protocols like HTTP, DNS, SMTP), Windows/Linux internals (processes, threads, memory management), file systems (NTFS, ext4), permissions (user roles, access control lists), network data flow (client-server, peer-to-peer). *Example*: Understanding how DNS queries can be exploited for data exfiltration.<br>**Learning Objectives**: Map how data flows across networks; identify where threats hide (e.g., rogue processes, misconfigured permissions); navigate OS environments to locate logs or suspicious activity; understand protocol basics for anomaly detection. *Example*: Spot unusual outbound DNS traffic in logs. | **Tools/Techniques**: Packet analysis (capturing/reading packets); OS navigation (command-line basics); log basics (event logs, syslog). **Tools**: ipconfig/ifconfig for network config, netstat for connections, ps/aux for process listing, Event Viewer (Windows), syslog (Linux). <br>**Resources**: *Books*: “Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach” (Kurose & Ross); *Online*: Khan Academy’s networking basics, Linux Journey for OS skills; *Labs*: VirtualBox VMs for safe Windows/Linux practice. *Time*: 40–50 hours. |
| Beginner | 3. Introduction to Threat Hunting | **Key Topics**: Threat hunting definition (proactive search for threats), differences from Incident Response (IR) and Digital Forensics (DFIR), hunt types (structured: hypothesis-driven; unstructured: exploratory; entity-driven: focus on assets), Pyramid of Pain (IoCs like hashes vs. TTPs like lateral movement), Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) vs. Indicators of Attack (IoAs). *Example*: Recognizing a suspicious login (IoA) vs. a known malware hash (IoC).<br>**Learning Objectives**: Define threat hunting’s purpose; understand hunt types and when to use them; learn basic threat modeling to form hypotheses; differentiate IoCs (reactive) from IoAs (proactive). *Example*: Hypothesize “an attacker may use PowerShell for persistence” and check for it. | **Tools/Techniques**: Hypothesis-based hunting (formulating/tested assumptions); anomaly detection (spotting outliers in logs). **Tools**: IOC Editor for managing indicators, Redline for basic endpoint analysis, PowerShell for simple queries (e.g., Get-Process). <br>**Resources**: *Courses*: Security Blue Team’s free intro, Coursera’s “Cyber Threat Hunting” Module 1; *Resources*: MITRE ATT&CK Navigator for TTP mapping, Active Countermeasures’ 6-hour free course. *Time*: 15–25 hours. |
| Beginner | 4. Basic Data Sources and Logs | **Key Topics**: Types of logs (system, network, application), Windows event logs (security, system, application logs), Linux syslog (auth, kernel, daemon logs), SIEM basics (centralized log aggregation), common log formats (JSON, CSV), spotting anomalies (e.g., repeated failed logins). *Example*: Identifying a brute-force attack via multiple Event ID 4625 in Windows logs.<br>**Learning Objectives**: Collect and parse logs from various sources; understand log structures; identify basic anomalies (e.g., unusual login times); learn SIEM’s role in aggregating logs for analysis. *Example*: Filter logs to find failed SSH attempts on a Linux server. | **Tools/Techniques**: Log parsing (extracting fields like timestamp, user); filtering (e.g., grep for specific keywords). **Tools**: Event Viewer for Windows logs, journalctl for Linux, grep/awk for text processing. <br>**Resources**: *Labs*: Splunk Free tutorials for SIEM basics, ELK Stack intro labs; *Books*: “Logging and Log Management” (Chuvakin); *Workshops*: CQURE’s 1-day log analysis intro. *Time*: 30–40 hours. |
| Beginner | 5. Hands-On Beginner Labs | **Key Topics**: Capture-the-Flag (CTF) challenges (e.g., find a hidden file, detect malware), intro to malware behavior (e.g., fileless scripts), simulated threats (e.g., mock phishing or ransomware). *Example*: Set up a lab to detect a simulated malicious process in a VM.<br>**Learning Objectives**: Apply cybersecurity and hunting concepts in controlled environments; practice identifying threats using logs and tools; develop confidence in safe lab settings. *Example*: Use Wireshark to capture and analyze traffic from a simulated malicious script. | **Tools/Techniques**: Lab setup (VMs for isolation), packet capture, basic threat simulation. **Tools**: VirtualBox for VMs, Metasploitable for vulnerable targets, Wireshark for traffic analysis. <br>**Resources**: *Platforms*: HackTheBox beginner tracks, TryHackMe’s free rooms; *Free Training*: Active Countermeasures’ hands-on labs, YouTube’s “Threat Hunting Masterclass” (2025). *Time*: 20–30 hours. |
