### How I'd Teach You Threat Hunting

As someone with SOC experience in threat investigations and log analysis, you're already ahead of the curve—threat hunting builds directly on those skills, shifting from reactive detection to proactive pursuit of adversaries. I'd teach you in a **structured, hands-on way** that leverages your background:

- **Approach**: We'd start with bite-sized modules blending theory (quick reads/videos) and practice (labs/simulations). I'd use real-world scenarios from your SOC days, like hunting for lateral movement in logs you already know. Sessions would be interactive: I'd pose hypotheticals, you'd hypothesize threats, and we'd iterate with feedback. Tools like ELK Stack, Splunk, or open-source alternatives (e.g., Zeek, Sigma) for labs—nothing overwhelming at first.
  
- **Pace**: 1-2 modules/week, with weekly "hunts" (e.g., analyze a sample dataset). Track progress via a personal hunting journal.

- **Resources**: Free/open-source where possible (MITRE ATT&CK, Atomic Red Team). I'd recommend books like *Hunting Cyber Criminals* by Vinny Troia, and communities like SANS Threat Hunting forums or Reddit's r/threathunting.

- **Goal**: From newbie to pro in 3-6 months, ending with a capstone: Lead a mock hunt on a simulated enterprise network.

Now, here's the **Table of Contents** for our "Pro Threat Hunter Bootcamp." It's modular, progressive, and practical—each chapter includes key concepts, skills, and a lab.

| Module | Title | Key Topics Covered | Skills Gained | Lab/Practice |
|--------|-------|--------------------|---------------|-------------|
| **1** | Introduction to Threat Hunting | - What is threat hunting vs. SOC ops (proactive vs. reactive)<br>- Why hunt? (Reduce dwell time, uncover APTs)<br>- Hunter mindset: Curiosity, persistence, hypothesis-driven<br>- Ethical/legal boundaries (e.g., scope of hunts) | Differentiate hunting from investigations; adopt a hunter's lens on your logs | Review a past SOC incident: Rewrite it as a hunt hypothesis. |
| **2** | Building on Your SOC Foundations | - Mapping log analysis to hunting (e.g., SIEM queries to hunt queries)<br>- Common pitfalls from reactive work (e.g., alert fatigue)<br>- Intro to hunt frameworks: Intelligence-led, hypothesis-led, entity/entity timeline | Refine log skills for hunting; choose a framework | Query sample logs in Splunk/ELK: Hunt for anomalous user behavior. |
| **3** | Threat Intelligence for Hunters | - Sources: OSINT, IOCs, TTPs (MITRE ATT&CK mapping)<br>- Threat actor profiles (e.g., nation-states vs. ransomware)<br>- Integrating intel into hunts (e.g., using MISP or ThreatConnect) | Collect/prioritize intel; map to your environment | Build a threat intel feed: Track a group like APT29 and hypothesize their next move. |
| **4** | Data Sources and Collection | - Endpoint (EDR like CrowdStrike), network (PCAPs, NetFlow), cloud (AWS logs)<br>- Log enrichment (e.g., adding geo-IP to firewall logs)<br>- Handling big data: Sampling, normalization | Identify/ingest diverse data; avoid blind spots | Set up a home lab: Collect logs from a VM network and enrich with open tools. |
| **5** | Hunting Methodologies | - Pyramid of Pain (shift from IOCs to TTPs)<br>- Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis<br>- Structured Analytic Techniques (e.g., ACH for hypotheses) | Formulate hunts systematically; validate assumptions | Apply Pyramid: Hunt a simulated breach dataset, escalating from IPs to behaviors. |
| **6** | Tools of the Trade | - Open-source: YARA/Sigma for rules, Volatility for memory, Wireshark for packets<br>- Commercial: BloodHound for AD, GRR for remote hunts<br>- Automation: Python scripting for custom hunts (e.g., with Pandas) | Deploy tools confidently; script basic hunts | Build a YARA rule: Scan malware samples for evasion techniques. |
| **7** | Hypothesis-Driven Hunting | - Craft hypotheses (e.g., "Adversary using living-off-the-land")<br>- Search strategies: Baseline anomalies, entity tracking<br>- False positives: Tuning and iteration | Generate/test hypotheses; iterate on failures | Full hunt cycle: Hypothesize, search, and report on a Kaggle dataset (e.g., ransomware logs). |
| **8** | Advanced Techniques | - Deception (honeypots, canaries)<br>- Machine learning for anomaly detection (e.g., isolation forests)<br>- Cross-domain hunts (e.g., OT/ICS environments)<br>- Evasion detection (fileless malware, C2 channels) | Tackle sophisticated threats; integrate ML lightly | Deploy a canary token: Simulate a hunt uncovering a decoy-triggered alert. |
| **9** | Case Studies and Real-World Hunts | - Breakdowns: SolarWinds, Colonial Pipeline<br>- Your SOC tie-in: Hunt similar patterns in enterprise data<br>- Reporting: Hunt stories, visualizations (e.g., timelines in Tableau) | Analyze failures/successes; communicate findings | Dissect a red team report: Re-hunt the engagement as blue team. |
| **10** | Pro Level: Scaling and Sustainability | - Team hunting (roles: lead, analyst)<br>- Metrics (e.g., hunts per quarter, findings value)<br>- Continuous improvement: CTFs, certifications (SANS FOR578)<br>- Future trends: AI-assisted hunting, zero-trust integration | Lead hunts; stay current | Capstone: Design/end-to-end hunt for a fictional org, present findings. |

By the end, you'll be running hunts that uncover threats your SOC might miss. Ready to dive into Module 1? Share a recent log analysis example from your work, and we'll hunt it together!
