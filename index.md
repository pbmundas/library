# This is my library

I’m Prasannakumar B Mundas, and I write about cybersecurity with over 10 years of hands-on experience in cybersecurity, I specialize in SOC operations, threat hunting, incident response, and threat intelligence. My career has been defined by my passion for proactively identifying and neutralizing cyber threats, designing end-to-end security processes, and empowering organizations to build resilient defenses.

My journey spans leading teams, building threat detection frameworks, and delivering managed security services for top-tier technology firms including Uptycs, ColorTokens, and CloudSEK. I’ve been recognized with multiple “Pat on the Back” and “Annual Champion” awards for my contributions, including designing forensic services and creating security value for Fortune 500 clients.

I thrive on collaborating with cross-functional teams to bridge security gaps, develop actionable playbooks, and implement predictive threat intelligence. As a freelance consultant, I help clients in the financial, healthcare, and technology sectors identify risks, remediate vulnerabilities, and strengthen their security postures.
